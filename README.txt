Friends-Inspired Snake — PWA
===========================

What you get:
- A single-page snake game (index.html, style.css, app.js)
- Procedurally generated royalty-free background music (assets/background.wav)
- Offline-capable PWA (manifest.json + sw.js)
- Icons in /assets (icon-192.png, icon-512.png)
- Obstacles, multiple power-ups (grow, shrink, invincible, score, speed boost), speed boosts, swipe & keyboard controls.
- High score stored in localStorage.

Notes & Limitations:
- This project is *Friends-inspired* in color and vibe only. It does not include or use any copyrighted images, audio, or logos from the "Friends" TV show.
- Browsers may block autoplay of audio; press the "Toggle Music" button if audio doesn't start automatically.
- To deploy: upload all files to a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). The service worker will cache files for offline use.
- If you want different icons or longer music, replace assets/background.wav and the icon files in /assets.
